Values
<family-name>
The name of a font family. For example, "Times" and "Helvetica" are font families. Font family names containing whitespace should be quoted. For example: "Comic Sans MS".

<generic-name>
Generic font families are a fallback mechanism, a means of preserving some of the style sheet author's intent when none of the specified fonts are available. Generic family names are keywords and must not be quoted. A generic font family should be the last item in the list of font family names. The following keywords are defined:

serif
Glyphs have finishing strokes, flared or tapering ends, or have actual serifed endings.

For example: Lucida Bright, Lucida Fax, Palatino, Palatino Linotype, Palladio, URW Palladio, serif.

sans-serif
Glyphs have stroke endings that are plain.

For example: Open Sans, Fira Sans, Lucida Sans, Lucida Sans Unicode, Trebuchet MS, Liberation Sans, Nimbus Sans L, sans-serif.

monospace
All glyphs have the same fixed width.

For example: Fira Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono, Menlo, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace.

cursive
Glyphs in cursive fonts generally have either joining strokes or other cursive characteristics beyond those of italic typefaces. The glyphs are partially or completely connected, and the result looks more like handwritten pen or brush writing than printed letter work.

For example: Brush Script MT, Brush Script Std, Lucida Calligraphy, Lucida Handwriting, Apple Chancery, cursive.

fantasy
Fantasy fonts are primarily decorative fonts that contain playful representations of characters.

For example: Papyrus, Herculanum, Party LET, Curlz MT, Harrington, fantasy.

system-ui
Glyphs are taken from the default user interface font on a given platform. Because typographic traditions vary widely across the world, this generic is provided for typefaces that don't map cleanly into the other generics.

ui-serif
The default user interface serif font.

ui-sans-serif
The default user interface sans-serif font.

ui-monospace
The default user interface monospace font.

ui-rounded
The default user interface font that has rounded features.

math
This is for the particular stylistic concerns of representing mathematics: superscript and subscript, brackets that cross several lines, nesting expressions, and double struck glyphs with distinct meanings.

emoji
Fonts that are specifically designed to render emoji.

fangsong
A particular style of Chinese characters that are between serif-style Song and cursive-style Kai forms. This style is often used for government documents.
